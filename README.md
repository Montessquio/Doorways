## Installing Doorways

The easiest way to install *Doorways* is to [subscribe to it on the Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2883549031).

If you prefer to install it manually, download the latest *Doorways.zip* release from the [Doorways releases page](https://github.com/Montessquio/Doorways/releases). Extract it and place the folder `sh.monty.Doorways` in your mods directory, which can be located by opening Cultist Simulator, clicking on "Settings", and pressing the button "Browse Files".

Once Doorways is installed, enable the mod in the "Invisible Serapeum" menu and make sure it is the very first mod in the list.
Finally, restart the game and you're good to go!
